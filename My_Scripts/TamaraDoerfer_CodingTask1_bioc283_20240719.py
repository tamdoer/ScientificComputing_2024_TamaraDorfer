## Import necessary packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pathlib import Path
from glob import glob
import os
import numpy as np

## Set path to data
path_to_data = Path("~/GIT/ScientificComputing_2024_TamaraDorfer/Data/mmsi-daily-csvs-10-v2-2020.zip")
path_to_data = path_to_data.expanduser()

##
file_list = path_to_data

for file in file_list:
    open(.csv)
